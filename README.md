Original authors: Ophelie Bleu, Ines Ben-Rached, Guillaume Dupont, Manal Zidani, Mathieu Lormeau

As part of the Data Camp course, we had to build  a data challenge addressing some social/science/business
problem using data obtained from external sources. 

#### Set up

Open a terminal and

1. install the `ramp-workflow` library (if not already done)
  ```
  $ pip install ramp
  ```
  
2. Follow the ramp-kits instructions from the [wiki](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki/Getting-started-with-a-ramp-kit)

## Get started

The  notebook [Starting_kit.ipynb](https://github.com/gouzmi/Bank-Telemarketing/blob/main/starting_kit.ipynb)
provides more details on this challenge and exploratory analysis on the data used.

To test the starting-kit, run

```
ramp_test_submission --submission starting_kit
```

#### Help
Go to the `ramp-workflow` [wiki](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki) for more help on the [RAMP](http:www.ramp.studio) ecosystem.
